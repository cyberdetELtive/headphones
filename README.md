Headphones Web Page
Welcome to the Headphones web page project! This is a fully functional web page designed by Lois Uzoma that looks the same as the designer file by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer. The objective is to implement the design from scratch using only HTML and CSS, without using external libraries like Bootstrap or JavaScript.
